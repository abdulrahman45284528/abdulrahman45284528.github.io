# 👋 Hello, I'm Abdul Rahman

I'm an **AI Engineer** passionate about building real-world intelligent systems that solve critical problems in **healthcare**, **computer vision**, and **language–vision integration**.

Currently working at **Siemens Healthineers** in Germany, I specialize in:
- Designing and optimizing **deep learning pipelines** for medical imaging
- Building **interactive analytics dashboards** from CT scanner telemetry
- Deploying robust **AI applications** using PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Django

## 🔬 My Technical Focus

- **Deep Learning & Transformers**: GPT, BERT, CLIP, CNNs, RNNs
- **Computer Vision**: Object detection with YOLO, image classification with ResNet, segmentation with EfficientNet
- **Vision–Language Models (VLMs)**: Prompt tuning, domain adaptation, and few-shot learning
- **Full-Stack AI Deployment**: Python | REST API | Django | Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)
- **Visualization & Monitoring**: Power BI | Grafana | Tableau | Azure Databricks
